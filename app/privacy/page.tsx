					</p>
					<p>
						We may process your information if you have given us specific
						permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information
						for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can
						be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can  withdraw your consent
						 at any time.
					</p>
					<p>
						In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under
						applicable law to process your information without your consent,
						including, for example:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and
							consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
						</li>
						<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
						<li>
							For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
						</li>
						<li>
							If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is

						</li>
						<li>
							For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and
							communicating with next of kin
						</li>
						<li>
							If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been,
							is, or may be victim of financial abuse
						</li>
						<li>

						</li>
						<li>
							If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant,

							literary purposes
						</li>
						<li>
							If the information is publicly available and is specified by the

							media account, we may have access to certain information about
							you.
						</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
						third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or
						Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
						certain profile information about you from your social media
						provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
						the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
						name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
						other information you choose to make public on such a social media
						platform.
					</p>
					<p>
						We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that
						are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made
						clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not
						control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
						information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
						that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect,
						use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your
						privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							<em>In Short:</em>
						</strong>
						 
						<em>
							We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries
							other than your own.
						</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing
						our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that
						your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us
						in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share
						your personal information (see &quot; WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE
						YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION? &quot; above), in Canada, and other
						countries.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United
						Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, then these countries may not
						necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as
						comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all
						necessary measures to protect your personal information in
						accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
					</p>
					<p>European Commission&#39;s Standard Contractual Clauses:</p>
					<p>
						We have implemented measures to protect your personal information,
						including by using the European Commission&#39;s Standard
						Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between
						our group companies and between us and our third-party providers.
						These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal
						information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in
						accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our
						Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have
						implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party
						service providers and partners and further details can be provided
						upon request.

						<strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							<em>In Short:</em>
						</strong>
						 
						<em>
							We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
							purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
							by law.
						</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
						necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
						longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
						tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
						notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
						than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
					</p>
					<p>
						When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
						personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
						information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
						personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
						will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
						any further processing until deletion is possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>
							<em>In Short:</em>
						</strong>
						 
						<em>
							We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
							organizational and technical security measures.
						</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
						organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
						any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
						and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
						over the Internet or information storage technology can be
						guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
						hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
						not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
						steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
						protect your personal information, transmission of personal
						information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
						only access the Services within a secure environment.
					</p>

						<em>
							We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under
							18 years of age.
						</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
						years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
						least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
						consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn
						that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
						been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
						measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
						become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
						age 18, please contact us at contact@raccoonv.com .
					</p>

						will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted
						in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
					</p>
					<p>
						**Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:**You can
						unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any
						time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send,

						administration and use of your account, to respond to service
						requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

						fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,
						enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
						requirements.

						<strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>

						Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
						applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or
						setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
						have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
						collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
						recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
						such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
						other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
						be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
						we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
						in a revised version of this privacy notice.

						Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
						determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
						in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
						provide information so that we can match it with information you

						request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
						that we can match the information you provide with the information
						we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
						communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously
						provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
						circumstances dictate.
					</p>
					<p>
						We will only use personal information provided in your request to
						verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
						possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
						for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
						identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
						request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
						verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
						purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
						soon as we finish verifying you.
